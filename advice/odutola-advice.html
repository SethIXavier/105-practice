			<p class="intro"><span>If there is one piece of advice I can give you, live in Dubai at least once in your life...</span>When StrawberryFrog, an Indie advertising frim beat advertising colossus Saatchi & Saatchi to Emaar’s Downtown Dubai account in 2010, they came up with the tagline; Centre of Now. In many respects, this rings true for the whole of the Emirate of Dubai and not just the downtown area. As such, the Centre of Now strove and dare I say, strives to remain just that. The “it” place. The place where it all happens, where the world wants to be and from the Government of Dubai’s perspective, where they want the world to come.</p>

			<p>In striving to maintain this status Dubai is always on to the next ‘it” thing, the biggest, the tallest, the widest, the deepest, the most magnificent…and the appellatives go on and on. It is in no way a coincidence that the city that house the world’s premiere 7 Star hotel is also home to the worlds’ tallest building and by 2020 will the home to the world’s 1st and 2nd tallest building. Dubai wants it all and more often than not, sets about getting it.</p>

			<p>In light of the foregoing and on hearing the announcement of another biggest mall, another unique tower, another magnificent island(s) or ground-breaking cutting edge project. One asks; when is enough enough? When does it all get too much? When does it become over ambition? (is there such a thing?) Dubai seems to be living by the quote from the 1989 movie; Field of Dreams – “If you build it, they will come”.</p>

			<p class="outro">This piece is not to knock the great things that are going on in the Emirate or what the Emirate stands for, I am an unapologetic fan of Dubai. It is rather intended to make us ask what if the plans as lofty as they are do not pan out as intended. From Egypt to Babylon, Greece to Rome and London to New York, the world is never short of a Centre of Now. While in contemporary times they do not wither and die like the ancient centres did, the contemporary ones inadvertently give way to the next centre. The Baby Boomers were all about New York, the Gen Xers were all about London, the Millennials are arguably all about Dubai, what will be the centre of now for Gen Z? will Dubai buck the trend and make 2 generations share one “now”? One gets the feeling that those in charge of the Emirate and looking at that next big project, that next big innovation will answer in the affirmative.<span> So...ready to buy that ticket?</span></p>
